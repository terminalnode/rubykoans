# Ruby Koans
This repository tracks my progress through the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/). Progress through the koans is made by correcting all of the failing asserts in the code, which demonstrates some of ruby's features.

To check progress, one runs rake in the repository. This shows what task to complete next, how much is completed and how much is left to do. It also gives the answer to the next problem and should thus be used sparingly.
